# Custom WPF Controls with Modern Design 🎨✨
Welcome to my GitHub repository containing a collection of custom controls for WPF (C#) with a modern design twist! 🙌 These controls are specifically designed to enhance the visual appeal and functionality of your WPF applications. 😊
## Usage 📝
To use these custom controls in your WPF application, simply add the following code to your App.xaml file:
```xaml
<ResourceDictionary>
    <ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
        <ResourceDictionary Source="Theme/WarningButtons.xaml"/>
        <ResourceDictionary Source="Theme/LocalDataBindings.xaml"/>
        <ResourceDictionary Source="Theme/Colors.xaml"/>
        <ResourceDictionary Source="Theme/Fonts.xaml"/>
        <ResourceDictionary Source="Theme/CustomTextBox.xaml"/>
        <ResourceDictionary Source="Theme/CustomButtons.xaml"/>
        <ResourceDictionary Source="Theme/CustomComboBox.xaml"/>
        <ResourceDictionary Source="Theme/CustomDatePicker.xaml"/>
        <ResourceDictionary Source="Theme/MacButtonStyle.xaml"/>
    </ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
</ResourceDictionary>
```
Once you've added this code, you'll have access to all the custom controls and can start using them in your WPF application. 🚀
